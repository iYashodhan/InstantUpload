# InstantUpload
A Instagram Bot that uploads pictures, writes caption including hashtags from a local directory in your machine. Here: https://www.instagram.com/livelikezen/ 

Description:
A simple yet elegant Instagram Bot that creates posts and upload it to your account from a local folder in your machine. 
You have to specify a folder from where it will upload images (you can keep adding pictures later as well), then, it writes caption, hashtags, current day etc for your post and 
upload the contents of the selected folder every time you run the script.

Technologies used:
Python -->
	Instagram Bot, Pillow, cv2, other basic libraries

Folders and why's:
Script >> This folder contains the main.py, backend.py (which contains account info i.e username, password, hastags)
Photos >> This folder contains: "Original post" (which contains all the images that will be posted), "Already Posted" (To keep a track of uploaded pictures)
instaupload.bat >> You can run the script directly from the "Windows Run"

Problems and wants:
1. The script can run in the background 24 and pictures can be uploaded on a once or several times according to the needs of the user.
2. Config folder gets created in Scripts and causes problem.

This was my first project with Python and I learned a lot of stuff. You can check out the instagram account that I am maintaining with this script, here: https://www.instagram.com/livelikezen/ 
Looking forward to any pull requests and requests
